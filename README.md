# Motion Blur Image Deblurring with Neural Networks

This project addresses the problem of image deblurring using deep learning techniques.  
The goal is to reconstruct sharp images from synthetically motion-blurred inputs, simulating hand-shake effects that occur during long-exposure photography.

The task is formulated as an image-to-image regression problem, where a neural network learns to map blurred images to their original sharp versions.

## Problem Description

Motion blur is a common degradation in real-world images, often caused by camera shake or object movement during exposure.

In this project, blurred images are generated by applying random motion trajectories to original images, simulating realistic hand tremor effects.  
The model is then trained to recover the original sharp image from the degraded input.

## Dataset

The experiments are conducted on images derived from the MNIST dataset.

- Original handwritten digits are used as clean ground truth.
- Motion blur is synthetically generated by randomly translating the image along a trajectory.
- The resulting dataset consists of paired samples: (blurred image, sharp image).

This controlled setting allows systematic evaluation of the deblurring performance.

## Methodology

The pipeline includes:

- Synthetic generation of motion-blurred images  
- Construction of paired training and validation sets  
- Design of a neural network for image restoration  
- Training with pixel-wise reconstruction loss  
- Quantitative and qualitative evaluation  

The task is treated as a supervised learning problem, where the model learns to invert the blur process.

## Results

The trained model is able to significantly reduce motion blur and reconstruct digit structures, demonstrating the effectiveness of neural architectures for image restoration tasks.

Both visual inspections and reconstruction metrics indicate a clear improvement over the blurred inputs.

Example qualitative results and training curves are reported in the notebook.
